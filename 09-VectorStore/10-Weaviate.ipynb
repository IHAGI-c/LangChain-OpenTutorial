    "## What is Weaviate?\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaviate is a powerful open-source vector database that revolutionizes how we store and search data. It combines traditional database capabilities with advanced machine learning features, allowing you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaviate is an open source [vector database](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-a-vector-database).\n",
    "- Weaviate allows you to store and retrieve data objects based on their semantic properties by indexing them with [vectors](./concepts/vector-index.md).\n",
    "- Weaviate can be used stand-alone (aka _bring your vectors_) or with a variety of [modules](./modules/index.md) that can do the vectorization for you and extend the core capabilities.\n",
    "- Weaviate has a [GraphQL-API](./api/graphql/index.md) to access your data easily.\n",
    "- Weaviate is fast (check our [open source benchmarks](./benchmarks/index.md)).\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Key Feature**: Weaviate achieves millisecond-level query performance, making it suitable for production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Weaviate?\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaviate stands out for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Versatility**: Supports multiple media types (text, images, etc.)\n",
    "2. **Advanced Features**:\n",
    "   - Semantic Search\n",
    "   - Question-Answer Extraction\n",
    "   - Classification\n",
    "   - Custom ML Model Integration\n",
    "3. **Production-Ready**: Built in Go for high performance and scalability\n",

    "- `properties`: List of property definitions for data schema\n",
    "- `vectorizer`: Configuration for vector embedding generation\n",
    "- `metric`: Distance metric for similarity calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Configuration Options:**\n",
    "- For custom distance metrics: Utilize the `VectorDistances` class\n",
    "- For alternative vectorization: Leverage the `Configure.Vectorizer` class\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Usage:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "properties = [\n",
    "    Property(name=\"text\", data_type=DataType.TEXT),\n",
    "    Property(name=\"title\", data_type=DataType.TEXT)\n",
